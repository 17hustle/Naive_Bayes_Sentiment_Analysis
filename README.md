# Naive_Bayes_Sentiment_Analysis:

Developed a Naive Bayes Sentiment Analysis Model from Scratch: Built a sentiment analysis classifier using Python and NLTK to predict the sentiment of tweets as positive or negative. Implemented data preprocessing techniques including tokenization, stopword removal, and handling of special characters to clean and prepare the text data for analysis.

Trained and Evaluated the Model on Twitter Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets, trained the Naive Bayes model using word frequency counts, and evaluated its performance. Achieved accurate sentiment predictions by calculating log-likelihoods and log-priors, and tested the model on custom tweets to demonstrate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
